          <p>Dekota is a Black Lab that is adoptable. He is 4 years old and he is a problem child.
            He has been abused and suffers from the abuse he has experienced. Therefore, he is not very
            friendly and will require a special person to adopt him. He needs someone that can give him a
            lot of attention to get over his abuse. He has improved at our shelter and we believe it is adoptable.
            If you would like to visit Dekota just leave a message in our Contact Page. </p>
